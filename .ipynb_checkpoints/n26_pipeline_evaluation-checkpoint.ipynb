       "0  To recognize a fraudulent text message, be aware of the following signs:\\n\\n1. **Unexpected Contact**: N26 never initiates contact via SMS. If you receive an SMS claiming to be from N26, it is likely fraudulent.\\n\\n2. **Links and Requests**: Avoid opening any links or providing any data if the message asks you to do so.\\n\\n3. **Urgency and Threats**: Fraudulent messages often use time-sensitive scenarios or ultimatums to pressure you into acting quickly.\\n\\n4. **Spelling and Grammar**: Pay attention to incorrect spelling and grammar, which can be a sign of a scam.\\n\\n5. **Sender Details**: Check the sender's details carefully. Scammers may use phone spoofing to disguise their number as that of the bank.\\n\\nIf you receive a suspicious message, take a screenshot including the sender's phone number and the date/time, and send it to support@n26.com. Do not interact with the message further.   \n",
